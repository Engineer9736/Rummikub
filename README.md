Remake of the game Rummikub, just to get my C++ skills going again.

Requirements:
- After the user has dragged and dropped a tile, the game should verify whether the intended move is legal. If not, revert back to the old situation.
- If the user their round finishes, and didn't have any tiles on the board before, check if the total sum of the tiles is at least 30. If not, revert back to the old situation.
